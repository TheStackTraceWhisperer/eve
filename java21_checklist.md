# Java 21 Migration and Adoption Checklist

Java 21 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release with significant new features and improvements. This checklist helps ensure a smooth migration and adoption process.

## Pre-Migration Assessment

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Verify current Java version and identify migration path
- [ ] Review application dependencies for Java 21 compatibility
- [ ] Check third-party libraries and frameworks for Java 21 support
- [ ] Update build tools (Maven 3.9.0+, Gradle 8.0+) for Java 21 compatibility
- [ ] Verify IDE support for Java 21 features
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines to use Java 21

### Code Analysis
- [ ] Run static analysis tools to identify potential compatibility issues
- [ ] Review usage of deprecated APIs that may be removed
- [ ] Identify code that could benefit from new Java 21 features
- [ ] Check for usage of internal APIs that may have changed

## Key Java 21 Features to Adopt

### Virtual Threads (Preview in Java 19-20, Standard in Java 21)
- [ ] Identify blocking I/O operations that could benefit from virtual threads
- [ ] Replace thread pools with virtual thread executors where appropriate
- [ ] Update thread creation patterns to use `Thread.ofVirtual()`
- [ ] Test application under load with virtual threads
- [ ] Monitor memory usage and performance improvements

### Pattern Matching for Switch (Standard in Java 21)
- [ ] Refactor complex switch statements to use pattern matching
- [ ] Replace instanceof chains with pattern matching
- [ ] Implement guard patterns where applicable
- [ ] Use pattern matching with sealed classes

### Record Patterns (Standard in Java 21)
- [ ] Identify places where record deconstruction would improve code readability
- [ ] Refactor nested data extraction to use record patterns
- [ ] Combine record patterns with switch expressions

### String Templates (Preview Feature)
- [ ] Evaluate string concatenation patterns for template adoption
- [ ] Consider migration from String.format() to string templates
- [ ] Implement custom template processors if needed

### Sequenced Collections
- [ ] Update code using List, Set, and Map to leverage new sequenced methods
- [ ] Use `getFirst()` and `getLast()` methods instead of index-based access
- [ ] Implement `addFirst()` and `addLast()` where appropriate

## Performance and JVM Improvements

### Garbage Collection
- [ ] Test with new garbage collection improvements
- [ ] Evaluate ZGC and G1GC enhancements
- [ ] Monitor memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Update JVM tuning parameters if necessary

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Benchmark application performance on Java 21
- [ ] Compare startup times and memory usage
- [ ] Test throughput improvements with virtual threads
- [ ] Validate performance under different workloads

## Security and Compliance

### Security Updates
- [ ] Review security improvements in Java 21
- [ ] Update security configurations if needed
- [ ] Test with updated security policies
- [ ] Verify cryptographic algorithm support

### Compliance
- [ ] Ensure licensing compliance with Oracle JDK or OpenJDK
- [ ] Update documentation with Java 21 requirements
- [ ] Verify regulatory compliance with new Java version

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create comprehensive test plan for Java 21 migration
- [ ] Test all application modules with Java 21
- [ ] Perform integration testing with dependencies
- [ ] Execute performance regression tests
- [ ] Test deployment procedures

### Compatibility Testing
- [ ] Test with different Java 21 distributions (Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, etc.)
- [ ] Verify compatibility with application servers
- [ ] Test database drivers and connection pools
- [ ] Validate third-party integrations

## Deployment and Operations

### Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Update production environment to Java 21
- [ ] Create rollback plan in case of issues
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting configurations
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts and automation

### Operations
- [ ] Monitor application health post-deployment
- [ ] Track performance metrics and improvements
- [ ] Document any issues and resolutions
- [ ] Train operations team on Java 21 specifics

## Code Quality and Best Practices

### Code Modernization
- [ ] Update coding standards to leverage Java 21 features
- [ ] Refactor legacy code patterns where beneficial
- [ ] Update code review guidelines
- [ ] Create developer documentation for new features

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create migration guides for development team
- [ ] Document new architectural patterns
- [ ] Update coding standards and guidelines

## Long-term Considerations

### Maintenance
- [ ] Plan for regular updates within Java 21 LTS lifecycle
- [ ] Establish process for evaluating future Java versions
- [ ] Monitor Java ecosystem for relevant updates
- [ ] Plan for next LTS migration strategy

### Skills Development
- [ ] Provide Java 21 training for development team
- [ ] Create learning resources and examples
- [ ] Establish knowledge sharing sessions
- [ ] Update interview and hiring criteria

## Common Pitfalls and Considerations

### Migration Risks
- [ ] Test memory-intensive applications thoroughly with virtual threads
- [ ] Verify thread-local variable behavior with virtual threads
- [ ] Check for proper resource cleanup in virtual thread contexts
- [ ] Monitor for potential deadlocks with mixed threading models

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Don't assume virtual threads solve all concurrency issues
- [ ] Profile applications to identify actual bottlenecks
- [ ] Consider virtual thread overhead for short-lived tasks
- [ ] Monitor garbage collection behavior changes

## Validation Checklist

### Final Verification
- [ ] All tests pass on Java 21
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds expectations
- [ ] No security regressions identified
- [ ] Documentation is updated and accurate
- [ ] Team is trained and ready for production deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are properly configured
- [ ] Rollback procedures are tested and documented
